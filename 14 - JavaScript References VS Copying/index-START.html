    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // THIS IS A SPECIAL CASE WITH THESE TYPES
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team, players)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux' // NOT THE SAME AS NUMBERS, STRINGS AND BOOLEANS!!! IT ALWAYS REFERS TO THE ORIGINAL ARRAY
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.splice() // if not arguments in splice, then it will make a copy
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const personCopy = person
    // personCopy.number = 99
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:9123132}) // the third arguments are option if you want to add properties to the object
    // object.assign will only clone one level deep!!! no nested properties will be referenced
    console.log(person2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const person3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    console.log(person3)
